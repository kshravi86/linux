# mm Directory

The `mm/` directory in the Linux kernel source tree is dedicated to memory management. It contains the core logic for how the kernel handles physical and virtual memory, including allocation, deallocation, paging, swapping, and various other memory-related operations.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `mm/` directory is to:

1.  **Manage physical memory**: Keep track of available and used physical memory pages.
2.  **Implement virtual memory**: Provide each process with its own isolated virtual address space and manage the mapping between virtual and physical addresses (paging).
3.  **Handle memory allocation**: Offer mechanisms for both kernel-internal memory allocation (e.g., slab allocators, vmalloc) and user-space memory requests (e.g., `mmap()`, `brk()`).
4.  **Implement swapping and page reclamation**: Move less-used memory pages to secondary storage (swap space) to free up physical memory, and reclaim pages for reuse.
5.  **Manage the page cache**: Cache file data in memory to speed up disk I/O.
6.  **Provide memory-related system calls**: Implement system calls like `mmap()`, `munmap()`, `mprotect()`, `brk()`, `sbrk()`.
7.  **Support advanced memory features**: Handle features like Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA), hugetlbpages (large pages), memory hotplug, and memory protection.

## Contents

The `mm/` directory is one of the most complex and critical parts of the kernel. Key files and subdirectories include:

*   **`memory.c`**: Core memory management functions, including page fault handling (`do_page_fault()`), page table manipulation helpers, and functions related to `mmap()` and `munmap()`.
*   **`page_alloc.c`**: The buddy allocator, which is the primary physical page allocator in the kernel. It manages free pages of different orders (powers of 2).
*   **`slab.c`, `slub.c`, `slob.c`**: Implementations of slab allocators. These are used for allocating kernel objects of specific sizes, reducing fragmentation and improving performance compared to direct page allocation for small objects. `slub.c` is the modern default.
*   **`vmalloc.c`**: Implements `vmalloc()`, which allocates virtually contiguous but physically non-contiguous memory regions in the kernel's address space. Useful for large, but not performance-critical, kernel allocations.
*   **`filemap.c`**: Manages the page cache, which caches file data read from or written to disk.
*   **`swap.c`, `swap_state.c`, `swapfile.c`**: Implement the swapping mechanism, including page-out to swap devices, page-in from swap, and management of swap spaces.
*   **`mmap.c`**: Handles memory mapping for processes, including the `mmap()` system call logic and management of Virtual Memory Areas (VMAs).
*   **`mprotect.c`**: Implements the `mprotect()` system call for changing memory protection flags.
*   **`msync.c`**: Implements the `msync()` system call for synchronizing memory-mapped regions with their backing store.
*   **`shmem.c`**: Implements `tmpfs` (a RAM-based filesystem) and System V shared memory (though the IPC-specific parts are in `ipc/shm.c`).
*   **`huge_memory.c`, `hugetlb.c`, `hugetlb_cgroup.c`**: Support for hugetlbpages, which are large physical pages (e.g., 2MB or 1GB instead of the usual 4KB) that can improve performance for applications with large memory footprints by reducing TLB pressure.
*   **`mempolicy.c`, `memcontrol.c` (and `cma.c`, `damon/`)**: NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) memory policy management and memory control groups (memcg) for resource limiting. `damon/` implements Data Access MONitor.
*   **`migrate.c`**: Code for migrating pages between physical memory locations, often used for NUMA balancing or memory hot-remove.
*   **`page-writeback.c`**: Manages the writing of dirty pages from the page cache back to disk.
*   **`readahead.c`**: Implements file readahead to proactively fetch file data into the page cache.
*   **`workingset.c`**: Logic for tracking the working set of processes (actively used memory).
*   **`ksm.c`**: Kernel Samepage Merging, a feature that deduplicates identical memory pages.
*   **`meminit.c` (in `arch/<arch>/mm/`) and `nobootmem.c`**: Early memory initialization. (`bootmem.c` is older).
*   **`kasan/`, `kfence/`, `kmsan/`**: Kernel Address Sanitizer (KASan), Kernel Electric-Fence (KFENCE), and Kernel Memory Sanitizer (KMSAN) for detecting memory errors.
*   **`percpu.c`**: Per-CPU variable allocation.
*   **`zswap.c`, `zsmalloc.c`, `zbud.c`, `z3fold.c`**: Components related to compressed RAM swapping/caching.
*   **`gup.c`**: Functions for `get_user_pages()`, which pin user-space pages in memory for direct kernel access (e.g., for DMA).
*   **`nommu.c`**: Memory management for systems without an MMU (Memory Management Unit), common in some embedded systems.
*   **`mremap.c`**: Implements the `mremap()` system call for resizing or moving memory mappings.
*   **`compaction.c`**: Memory compaction, which tries to create larger contiguous free memory blocks.
*   **`userfaultfd.c`**: User-space page fault handling.
*   **`memblock.c`**: Early memory allocator used before the buddy system is fully operational.

## Use for Linux OS

The memory management subsystem is one of the most fundamental parts of the Linux kernel. It is responsible for:

*   **Process Isolation**: Giving each process its own virtual address space, preventing processes from interfering with each other's memory.
*   **Efficient Memory Usage**: Allocating and deallocating memory efficiently, minimizing fragmentation, and using techniques like swapping and page caching to make the most of available RAM.
*   **Abstracting Hardware**: Providing a consistent view of memory to the rest of the kernel and user space, regardless of the underlying hardware specifics (though `arch/<arch>/mm/` handles the hardware details).
*   **Performance**: Optimizing memory access patterns, reducing page faults, and speeding up I/O through caching.
*   **Security**: Enforcing memory protection (read, write, execute permissions) and providing mechanisms like ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization).
*   **Resource Control**: Allowing administrators to set limits on memory usage for processes or groups of processes (cgroups).

The `mm/` directory contains the code that makes all of this possible. It is a highly complex area of the kernel, and changes here can have profound effects on system stability, performance, and security. Developers working in this area require a deep understanding of both software algorithms and hardware memory architectures.
