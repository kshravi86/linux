# drivers Directory

This directory houses the source code for all device drivers in the Linux kernel. Device drivers are essential pieces of software that allow the kernel to interact with and control hardware components.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `drivers/` directory is to provide a modular and organized way to manage the vast array of hardware that Linux supports. Each subdirectory typically corresponds to a class of devices (e.g., `net/` for network devices, `gpu/` for graphics processing units, `usb/` for Universal Serial Bus devices).

## Contents

The `drivers/` directory is one of the largest and most diverse in the kernel tree. Its structure is generally based on the type of hardware the drivers support. Common subdirectories include:

*   **`acpi/`**: Drivers related to ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface), which is used for hardware discovery, configuration, power management, and other OS-level functions.
*   **`ata/`**: Drivers for ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment) host controllers, which are used for connecting storage devices like hard drives and SSDs.
*   **`block/`**: Drivers for block devices, which are storage devices that read and write data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., hard drives, SSDs, floppy disks).
*   **`bluetooth/`**: Drivers for Bluetooth controllers and devices.
*   **`char/`**: Drivers for character devices, which handle data as a stream of characters. This includes devices like serial ports, TTYs (teletypewriters), and random number generators.
*   **`clk/`**: Drivers for clock controllers, which manage the clock signals required by various hardware components.
*   **`dma/`**: Drivers for DMA (Direct Memory Access) controllers, which allow hardware to access system memory directly without CPU intervention.
*   **`firmware/`**: Code related to loading and managing firmware for various devices.
*   **`gpio/`**: Drivers for GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) controllers, which allow software to control and read the state of digital pins.
*   **`gpu/`**: Drivers for Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), primarily under the `drm/` (Direct Rendering Manager) subdirectory.
*   **`hid/`**: Drivers for Human Interface Devices (HID) such as keyboards, mice, joysticks, and touchscreens.
*   **`hwmon/`**: Drivers for hardware monitoring devices, which provide information about system temperature, voltage, fan speeds, etc.
*   **`i2c/`**: Drivers for I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus adapters and devices.
*   **`iio/`**: Drivers for Industrial I/O (IIO) devices, which include sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and ADCs/DACs.
*   **`input/`**: Drivers for input devices, including keyboards, mice, touchpads, and joysticks.
*   **`irqchip/`**: Drivers for interrupt controllers.
*   **`md/`**: Drivers for Multiple Devices (MD), such as software RAID.
*   **`media/`**: Drivers for multimedia devices, including webcams, TV tuners, video capture cards, and radio receivers.
*   **`misc/`**: Miscellaneous drivers that don't fit neatly into other categories.
*   **`mmc/`**: Drivers for MMC (MultiMediaCard), SD (Secure Digital), and SDIO (Secure Digital Input/Output) host controllers and cards.
*   **`mtd/`**: Drivers for Memory Technology Devices (MTD), which are typically flash memory devices (e.g., NOR and NAND flash).
*   **`net/`**: Drivers for network interface controllers (NICs), including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth networking, and various other network protocols. This is one of the largest subdirectories.
*   **`nfc/`**: Drivers for Near Field Communication (NFC) controllers.
*   **`pci/`**: Drivers and support code for the PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) and PCIe (PCI Express) bus.
*   **`pinctrl/`**: Drivers for pin controllers (pinmux), which manage the multiplexing and configuration of hardware pins.
*   **`platform/`**: Drivers for platform-specific devices, often found on embedded systems or SoCs (System on a Chip).
*   **`power/`**: Drivers related to power management, such as battery drivers and power supply monitors.
*   **`pwm/`**: Drivers for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) controllers.
*   **`regulator/`**: Drivers for voltage and current regulators.
*   **`reset/`**: Drivers for reset controllers.
*   **`rtc/`**: Drivers for Real-Time Clocks (RTCs).
*   **`scsi/`**: Drivers for SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) host adapters and devices.
*   **`spi/`**: Drivers for SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) bus controllers and devices.
*   **`thermal/`**: Drivers for thermal management, including temperature sensors and cooling devices.
*   **`tty/`**: Drivers and infrastructure for Teletypewriters (TTYs), including serial ports and virtual consoles.
*   **`usb/`**: Drivers for USB (Universal Serial Bus) host controllers, hubs, and devices. This is another very large subdirectory.
*   **`video/`**: Drivers for framebuffers and console display. Note that most GPU drivers are in `gpu/drm/`.
*   **`watchdog/`**: Drivers for watchdog timers, which are hardware timers used to detect and recover from system hangs.

## Use for Linux OS

The `drivers/` directory is critical for the Linux kernel's ability to function on a wide variety of hardware. Its main roles include:

*   **Hardware Interaction**: Providing the low-level code necessary to communicate with specific hardware components.
*   **Abstraction**: Presenting a standardized interface to the rest of the kernel for different types of devices (e.g., all network cards use the netdev interface, all block devices use the block layer interface). This allows the core kernel to be hardware-agnostic.
*   **Modularity**: Allowing drivers to be compiled as loadable kernel modules (`.ko` files). This means that only the drivers needed for the currently connected hardware need to be loaded into memory, saving resources. It also allows for third-party drivers to be added without recompiling the entire kernel.
*   **Hardware Discovery and Initialization**: Detecting, initializing, and configuring hardware devices during system boot or when they are hot-plugged.
*   **Power Management**: Implementing power-saving features for specific devices.
*   **Error Handling**: Managing and reporting errors from hardware devices.

Without the extensive collection of drivers in this directory, Linux would not be able to support the vast ecosystem of hardware it currently runs on. Contributions to this directory are a major part of kernel development, enabling support for new and existing hardware.
