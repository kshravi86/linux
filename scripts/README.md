# scripts Directory

The `scripts/` directory in the Linux kernel source tree contains a collection of scripts and small utility programs used primarily during the kernel build process, for development assistance, and for various administrative or debugging tasks.

## Purpose

The primary purposes of the `scripts/` directory are:

1.  **Support the Kernel Build Process (Kbuild)**: Many scripts are integral to compiling the kernel, managing dependencies, generating configuration files, linking the final kernel image, and building modules.
2.  **Development Aids**: Provide tools for kernel developers, such as code style checkers, patch manipulation utilities, and debugging aids.
3.  **Configuration Management**: Scripts for handling kernel configuration (`.config` file), including `menuconfig`, `nconfig`, `xconfig`-like interfaces (though the C sources for these are often elsewhere, e.g., `scripts/kconfig/`).
4.  **Packaging and Installation**: Scripts to help with packaging the kernel or installing modules.
5.  **Documentation Generation**: Tools used in the process of generating kernel documentation.
6.  **Miscellaneous Utilities**: Various other helper scripts for specific tasks related to kernel development or analysis.

## Contents

The `scripts/` directory is diverse, containing shell scripts (Bash, sh), Perl scripts, Python scripts, and some small C programs. Key components and subdirectories include:

*   **Core Build Scripts (directly in `scripts/`)**:
    *   `Makefile.*`: Various Makefiles included by the main kernel Makefile to define build rules for different stages or components (e.g., `Makefile.build`, `Makefile.clean`, `Makefile.host`, `Makefile.modpost`).
    *   `mkconfigs`: Script to generate configuration header files.
    *   `mod/`: Contains `modpost.c` (used to process modules during build) and related scripts.
    *   `link-vmlinux.sh`: Script responsible for linking the final `vmlinux` kernel image.
    *   `recordmcount.pl`: Perl script for processing mcount call sites for ftrace.
    *   `setlocalversion`: Script to determine the local version string to append to the kernel version (e.g., based on Git tags or local changes).
    *   `extract-certs`: Script to extract signing keys from the kernel image.
    *   `extract-ikconfig`: Script to extract the in-kernel config (`.config`) from a `vmlinux` image.

*   **`kconfig/`**: Contains the source code for the Kconfig utilities (`conf`, `mconf`, `nconf`) that are used to parse `Kconfig` files and generate the kernel `.config` file. These provide text-based and ncurses-based configuration interfaces.
    *   `conf.c`: The 'conf' utility (e.g., for `make oldconfig`).
    *   `mconf.c`: The 'mconf' utility (for `make menuconfig`).
    *   `nconf.c`: The 'nconf' utility (for `make nconfig`).
    *   `parser.y`, `lexer.l`: Lexer and parser for Kconfig files.

*   **`dtc/`**: Device Tree Compiler (DTC) source code. DTC is used to compile Device Tree Source (`.dts`) files into Device Tree Blobs (`.dtb`) which are used by the kernel to discover and configure hardware on many platforms (especially ARM, PowerPC, RISC-V).

*   **`checkpatch.pl`**: A Perl script that checks patches and code for conformance to the Linux kernel coding style.
*   **`get_maintainer.pl`**: A Perl script that helps identify the maintainers and mailing lists relevant to a given file or patch.

*   **`gdb/`**: Scripts to aid in debugging the kernel with GDB (GNU Debugger), such as pretty-printers for kernel data structures.

*   **`package/`**: Scripts to help create kernel packages for various distributions (e.g., `builddeb` for Debian packages, `buildrpm` for RPM packages).

*   **`selftests/`**: Infrastructure and scripts for running kernel selftests (though the actual tests are mostly in `tools/testing/selftests/`).

*   **`tracing/`**: Scripts related to kernel tracing, often for use with ftrace or perf.

*   **`pahole/` (if enabled)**: Scripts related to `pahole` (Poke-A-Hole), a tool for analyzing and reducing data structure padding and improving cache performance.

*   **`rust/`**: Scripts specific to building Rust code within the kernel.

*   **`coccinelle/`**: Scripts and Semantic Patches (SP) for use with Coccinelle, a tool for automated code transformation and analysis.

*   **`decode_stacktrace.sh`**: A shell script to decode kernel oops messages and stack traces using a System.map file.

*   **`genksyms/`**: Contains `genksyms.c`, used for generating symbol version information (CRCs) for modules if `CONFIG_MODVERSIONS` is enabled.

*   **`headers_install.sh`**: Script responsible for installing the sanitized kernel headers (UAPI headers) to a specified location.

*   **`kernel-doc`**: A Perl script used to extract kernel-doc comments from source code to generate documentation.

*   **`pahole-flags.sh`**: Script to determine appropriate flags for `pahole`.

*   **`resource_tool.py`**: Python script for managing Windows-style resource files, sometimes used for UEFI.

## Use for Linux OS

While most scripts in the `scripts/` directory are not directly part of the running Linux OS, they are indispensable for its development, compilation, and maintenance:

*   **Kernel Compilation**: The Kbuild system heavily relies on these scripts to manage the complex process of building the kernel for numerous architectures and configurations.
*   **Kernel Configuration**: `scripts/kconfig/` provides the tools that allow users to customize kernel features.
*   **Device Tree**: `scripts/dtc/` is essential for systems that use Device Trees to describe their hardware.
*   **Developer Workflow**: Scripts like `checkpatch.pl` and `get_maintainer.pl` are standard tools for kernel developers to ensure code quality and proper patch submission.
*   **Debugging**: GDB scripts and stack trace decoders aid in diagnosing kernel issues.
*   **Packaging**: Facilitates the creation of distributable kernel packages.
*   **Maintaining Code Quality**: Coding style checkers and other analysis tools help maintain a consistent and high-quality codebase.

The `scripts/` directory is a critical support system for the Linux kernel, enabling its development, customization, and distribution across a vast and diverse ecosystem.
